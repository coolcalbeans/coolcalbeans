- 🌱 Follow what I’m currently reading 📚 [here](https://info.diafora.io) ...
- 💬 Ask me about 🤖 Emerging Technology, 💰 Finance, 🪙 Economics, 🌳 Investing, 🎨 Growth Marketing, 📈 Analytics, 💻 Information Science, LAMP Stack 🥞 ...
- 🔧 I like to think that I'm a jack of a few trades but master of at least one - stargazing 🔭 and technology 💿...
- 🚥 Albeit with a fair warning that I find myself woefully and painfully wrong about a lot of things about technology these days, that I smile 😊 and ground myself by re-reading this old article on [what is code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/), once in a while...

<sub>Personal opinons of mine, though mostly fact based can be influenced by axioms. Facts along with all facets of their constraints resonate more with the engineer / tinkerer, in me, than axioms. All that to say all things I follow, read and subscribe to, as much as they are are debatable with facts and axioms, should be construed exactly as it says: **personal opinions only** 🍻.</sub>
